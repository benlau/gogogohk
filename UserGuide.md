  * Planning - The page you perform searching for route from point A to point B on a Google Map
  * Transit Information - The page contains transportation data. For example, transport service provides, stops, routes, etc.

Click either the planning links on the top or the big right blue button and you will be directed to the planning page.

In the planning page, you can either use the following ways to fix the query starting point and ending point on the Google Map. Starting/Ending point is a location or street name like "Mong Kok", "mk", "tst", "cwb", "Causeway bay", "Shanghai St, Kowloon, Hong Kong", etc.

  * Opt1 - Enter a location in the textbox and either press enter-key or click on the magnifier button. After pressing the magnifier button, your Google Map will zoom to the street level and you can adjust (drag-n-drop) the marker's position as you wish (highlighted Cyan marker as shown in second image followed).

  * Opt2 - Right click on Google Map and you get the context menu.
    * "Go from here" sets the pointing location in the "From" textbox in Opt1
    * "Go to here" sets the pointing location in the "To" textbox in Opt1
    * "Zoom to street" ask your Google Map to zoom to predefined street level at pointing location
    * "Zoom default" ask your Google Map to zoom to default zoom level ... entire HK.

  * Opt 3 - Using Google Search in Google Map. It searches within the area the map is showing. Business search is also allowed for example, zoom to "Mong Kok" and search "McDonald". A list of search result will be shown above the search box (as shown in second image followed).
